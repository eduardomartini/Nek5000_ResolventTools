# Nek5000 Resolvent Tools : Resolvent modes

**Nek5000 ResolventTools : Resolvent modes** provides a matrix-free iteractive approach to obtain optimal harmonic forces, responses and the associated gains. The method consists of a time-march approach to compute the action of the resolvent operators on a vector for multiple frequencies simultaneously, which is coupled to Power-iteration and Arnoldi algorithms to obtain leading modes and gains.  The method is described in [1]

Code that explore the transient response method (TRM) and steady-state response method (SSRM) are contained in subfolders, along with usage instructions.
